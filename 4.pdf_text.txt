 
Abstract—Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) has emerged 
as a key technology to provide real-time health monitoring of a 
patient and to diagnose and treat many life threatening diseases. 
WBAN operates in close vicinity to, on, or inside a human body 
and supports a variety of medical and non-medical applications. 
IEEE 802 has established a Task Group called IEEE 802.15.6 for 
the standardization of WBAN. The purpose of the group is to 
establish a communication standard optimized for low-power inbody/on-body nodes to serve a variety of medical and non-medical 
applications. This paper explains the most important features 
of the new IEEE 802.15.6 standard. The standard deﬁnes a 
Medium Access Control (MAC) layer supporting several Physical 
(PHY) layers. We brieﬂy overview the PHY and MAC layers 
speciﬁcations together with the bandwidth efﬁciency of IEEE 
802.15.6 standard. We also discuss the security paradigm of the 
standard. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has a great potential 
to revolutionize the future of healthcare technology. It has 
attracted a number of researchers both from the academia 
and industry in the past few years. WBAN supports a wide 
range of medical and Consumer Electronics (CE) applications. 
For example, WBAN provides remote health monitoring of a 
patient’s state for a long period of time without any restriction 
on his/her normal activities [1]-[2]. For a successful implementation of WBAN, a standard model was required which 
would be able to address both medical and CE applications. 
IEEE 802 established a Task Group called IEEE 802.15.6 
for the standardization of WBAN [3]. Earlier, IEEE 802 had 
many success stories in developing international standards on 
wireless communication. Examples include IEEE 802.11 [4], 
IEEE 802.15.1 [5] and IEEE 802.15.4 [6] standards. The 
purpose of the IEEE 802.15.6 was to deﬁne new Physical 
(PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers for WBAN. 
The selection of the PHYs (frequency bands) were one of 
the most important issues. Generally, the available frequencies 
for WBANs are regulated by communication authorities in 
different countries. Fig. 1 shows a short summary of some of 
the frequency bands available for WBAN in different countries 
[7]. Medical Implant Communications Service (MICS) band 
is a licensed band used for implant communication and has 
the same frequency range (402-405 MHz) in most of the 
countries. Wireless Medical Telemetry Services (WMTS) is 
a licensed band used for medical telemetry system. Both 
MICS and WMTS bandwidths do not support high data rate 
applications. The Industrial, Scientiﬁc and Medical (ISM)

Fig. 1. Frequency bands for WBAN [7] 
band supports high data rate applications and is available 
worldwide. However, there are high chances of interference 
since many wireless devices including IEEE 802.1 and IEEE 
802.15.4 operate at ISM band. 
The current IEEE 802.15.6 standard deﬁnes three PHY 
layers, i.e., Narrowband (NB), Ultra wideband (UWB), and 
Human Body Communications (HBC) layers. The selection of 
each PHY depends on the application requirements. On the top 
of it, the standard deﬁnes a sophisticated MAC protocol that 
controls access to the channel. For time referenced resource 
allocations, the hub (or the coordinator) divides the time axis 
(or the channel) into a series of superframes. The superframes 
are bounded by beacon periods of equal length. To ensure 
high level security, the standard deﬁnes three levels: 1) level 
0 - unsecured communication, 2) level 1 - authentication only, 
3) level 2 - both authentication and encryption. In this paper, 
we brieﬂy overview the PHY and MAC layers speciﬁcations 
together with the bandwidth efﬁciency of IEEE 802.15.6 
standard for different frequency bands and data rates. We also 
discuss the security paradigm of the standard. 
The rest of the paper is organized into three sections. Section 
I discusses WBAN applications targeted by the standard. 
Section II presents the PHY and MAC layers speciﬁcations. 
This section also presents the bandwidth efﬁciency and the 
security paradigm of the standard. The ﬁnal section concludes 
our work with useful remarks. 
II. TARGET APPLICATIONS 
The WBAN applications targeted by the IEEE 802.15.6 
standard are divided into medical and non-medical applications 
as given in Fig. 2. Medical applications include collecting vital 
information of a patient continuously and forward it to a remote monitoring station for further analysis. This huge amount

also be used to help people with disabilities. For example, 
retina prosthesis chips can be implanted in the human eye 
to see at an adequate level. Non-medical applications include 
monitoring forgotten things, data ﬁle transfer, gaming, and 
social networking applications. In gaming, sensors in WBAN 
can collect coordinates movements of different parts of the 
body and subsequently make the movement of a character in 
the game, e.g., moving soccer player or capturing the intensity 
of a ball in table tennis. Using WBAN in social networking 
allows people to exchange digital proﬁle or business card only 
by shaking hands.

III. IEEE 802.15.6 DESCRIPTION 
The following sections describe the main features of IEEE 
802.15.6 standard including PHY and MAC layers speciﬁcations. 
A. PHY Layer Speciﬁcation 
As mentioned earlier, the IEEE 802.15.6 supports three 
different PHYs, i.e., NB, UWB, and HBC. 
1) Narrowband PHY (NB): The NB PHY is responsible for 
activation/deactivation of the radio transceiver, Clear Channel 
Assessment (CCA) within the current channel and data transmission/reception. The Physical Protocol Data Unit (PPDU) 
frame of NB PHY contains a Physical Layer Convergence 
Procedure (PLCP) preamble, a PLCP header, and a PHY 
Service Data Unit (PSDU) as given in Fig 3. The PLCP 
preamble helps the receiver in the timing synchronization 
and carrier-offset recovery. It is the ﬁrst component being 
transmitted. The PLCP header conveys information necessary 
for a successful decoding of a packet to the receiver. The 
PLCP header is transmitted after PLCP preamble using the 
given header data rate in the operating frequency band. The 
last component of PPDU is PSDU which consists of a MAC 
header, MAC frame body, Frame Check Sequence (FCS) and 
is transmitted after PLCP header using any of the available 
data rates in the operating frequency band. A WBAN device 
should be able to support transmission and reception in one 
of the frequency bands summarized in Table I. The table 
further shows the data-rate dependent modulations parameters 
for PLCP header and PSDU. In NB PHY, the standard uses 
Differential Binary Phase-shift Keying (DBPSK), Differential 
Quadrature Phase-shift Keying (DQPSK), and Differential 8Phase-shift Keying (D8PSK) modulation techniques except

420-450 MHz which uses a Gaussian minimum shift keying 
(GMSK) technique. 
2) Ultra Wideband PHY (UWB): UWB PHY operates in 
two frequency bands: low band and high band. Each band is 
divided into channels, all of them characterized by a bandwidth 
of 499.2 MHz. The low band consists of 3 channels (1-3) only. 
The channel 2 has a central frequency of 3993.6 MHz and is 
considered a mandatory channel. The high band consists of 
eight channels (4-11) where channel 7 with a central frequency 
7987.2 MHz is considered a mandatory channel. While all 
other channels are optional. A typical UWB device should 
support at least one of the mandatory channels. The UWB 
PHY transceivers allow low implementation complexity and 
generate signal power levels in the order of those used in the 
MICS band. 
Fig. 4 shows the UWB PPDU that contains a Synchronization Header (SHR), a PHY Header (PHR), and a PSDU. The 
SHR is composed of a preamble and a Start Frame Delimiter 
(SFD). The PHR conveys information about the data rate of 
the PSDU, length of the payload and scrambler seed. The 
information in the PHR is used by the receiver in order to

802.15.6 NB PPDU structure 
802.15.6 UWB PPDU structure 
802.15.6 EFC PPDU structure 
decode the PSDU. The SHR is formed of repetitions of Kasami 
sequences of length 63. Typical data rates range from 0.5 Mbps 
up to 10 Mbps with 0.4882 Mbps as the mandatory one. 
3) Human Body Communications PHY (HBC): HBC PHY 
operates in two frequency bands centered at 16 MHz and 
27 MHz with the bandwidth of 4 MHz. Both operating 
bands are valid for the United States, Japan, and Korea, and 
the operating band at 27MHz is valid for Europe. HBC is 
the Electrostatic Field Communication (EFC) speciﬁcation 
of PHY, which covers the entire protocol for WBAN such 
as packet structure, modulation, preamble/SFD, etc. Fig. 5 
describes the PPDU structure of EFC, which is composed of 
a preamble, SFD, PHY header and a PSDU. The preamble 
and SFD are ﬁxed data patterns. They are pre-generated and 
sent ahead of the packet header and payload. The preamble 
sequence is transmitted four times in order to ensure packet 
synchronization while the SFD is transmitted only once. When 
the packet is received by the receiver, it ﬁnds the start of the 
packet by detecting the preamble sequence, and then it ﬁnds 
the start of the frame by detecting the SFD.

B. MAC Layer Speciﬁcation 
In IEEE 802.15.6, the entire channel is divided into superframe structures. Each superframe is bounded by a beacon 
period of equal length. The hub selects the boundaries of the 
beacon period and thereby selects the allocation slots. The 
hub may also shift the offsets of the beacon period. Generally, 
the beacons are transmitted in each beacon period except in 
inactive superframes or unless prohibited by regulations such 
as in MICS band. The IEEE 802.15.6 network operates in one 
of the following modes. 
1) Beacon mode with beacon period superframe boundaries: In this mode, the beacons are transmitted by the 
hub in each beacon period except in inactive superframes or 
unless prohibited by regulations. Fig. 6 shows the superframe 
strucutre of IEEE 802.15.6, which is divided into Exclusive 
Access Phase 1 (EAP1), Random Access Phase 1 (RAP1), 
Type I/II phase, Exclusive Access Phase 2 (EAP 2), Random 
Access Phase 2 (RAP 2), Type I/II phase, and a Contention 
Access Phase (CAP). In EAP, RAP and CAP periods, nodes 
contend for the resource allocation using either CSMA/CA or a 
slotted Aloha access procedure. The EAP1 and EAP2 are used 
for highest priority trafﬁc such as reporting emergency events. 
The RAP1, RAP2, and CAP are used for regular trafﬁc only. 
The Type I/II phases are used for uplink allocation intervals, 
downlink allocation intervals, bilink allocation intervals, and 
delay bilink allocation intervals. In Type I/II phases, polling 
is used for resource allocation. Depending on the application 
requirements, the coordinator can disable any of these periods 
by setting the duration length to zero. 
2) Non-beacon mode with superframe boundaries: In this 
mode, the entire superframe duration is covered either by a 
type I or a type II access phase but not by both phases.

802.15.6 superframe structure 
procedure in IEEE 802.15.6 standard 
3) Non-beacon mode without superframe boundaries: In 
this mode, the coordinator provides unscheduled Type II polled 
allocation only. 
The access mechanisms used in each period of the superframe are divided into three categories: 1) Random access mechanism, which uses either CSMA/CA or a slotted 
Aloha procedure for resource allocation, 2) Improvised and 
unscheduled access (connectionless contention-free access), 
which uses unscheduled polling/posting for resource allocation, and 3) Scheduled access and variants (connectionoriented contention-free access), which schedules the allocation of slots in one or multiple upcoming superframes, 
also called 1-periodic or m-periodic allocations. These mechanisms are comprehensively discussed in the standard. Here 
we explain the basic procedures of the CSMA/CA protocol 
deﬁned in the standard. In CSMA/CA, a node sets its backoff 
counter to a random integer number uniformly distributed 
over the interval [1,CW] where CW ∈ (CW ,CW ). 
min max 
The values of of CW and CW vary depending on 
min max 
the user priorities. The node starts decrementing the backoff 
counter by one for each idle CSMA slot of duration equal 
to pCSMASlotLength. The data is transmitted when the 
backoff counter reaches zero. The CW is doubled for each 
failure until it reaches CW . Fig. 7 shows the CSMA/CA 
max 
procedure. In RAP1, the node ﬁrst waits forSIFS = pSIFS 
duration and then unlocks the backoff counter until it reaches 
zero where the data transmission starts. In CAP, the node locks 
the backoff counter since the time between the end of the slot 
and the end of the CAP is not enough for completing data 
transmission and a Nominal Guard Time represented by GT . 
n 
The backoff counter is unlocked in the next RAP2 period. 
To measure the spectral utilization of IEEE 802.15.6 when 
using CSMA/CA procedure, we analyze the bandwidth ef978-1-4244-8132-3/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE

ﬁciency for different frequency bands and data rates. The 
bandwidth efﬁciency is inversely proportional to the basic 
data rate. The following assumptions are considered during the 
calculations. 1) Bit Error Rate (BER) is zero, 2) The channel 
is perfect with no losses due to collisions, 3) The node always 
has a packet to send, 4) There are no packet losses due to 
buffer overﬂow. Fig. 8 presents the bandwidth efﬁciency as 
a function of payload size. It can be seen that the efﬁciency 
increases as we increase the payload size, i.e., it is 83.6% 
for 187.5 Kbps and 69.4% for 971 Kbps, respectively. These 
results can help the application protocol designer to see the 
effects of the payload size on the bandwidth efﬁciency and 
can be used to minimize jitter in multimedia applications 
C. Security Paradigm 
The standard deﬁnes the following three levels of security. 
Each security level has different security properties, protection 
levels and frame formats. 
1) Level 0 - unsecured communication: This is the lowest 
security level where data is transmitted in unsecured frames. 
There is no mechanism for data authentication and integrity, 
conﬁdentiality and privacy protection, and replay defense.

ﬁciency of IEEE 802.15.6 
structure of IEEE 802.15.6 
2) Level 1 - authentication only: This is the medium security level where data is transmitted in secured authentication 
but is not encrypted. The conﬁdentially and privacy is not 
supported by this mode. 
3) Level 3 - authentication and encryption: This is the 
highest security level where data is transmitted in secured 
authentication and encryption frames. It provides solutions to 
all of the problems not covered by the level 0 and level 1. 
The required security level is selected during the association 
process, i.e., when a node is joining the network. For unicast 
communication, a pre-shared Master Key (MK) or a new 
key (established via unauthenticated association) is activated. 
Then a Pairwise Temporal Key (PTK) is established, which 
is used once per session. For multicast communication, a 
Group Temporal Key (GTK) is shared with the corresponding 
multicast group. The whole security structure is given in Fig. 
9. 
IV. CONCLUSION

802.15.6 standard. We studied the PHY and MAC layers 
speciﬁcations and identiﬁed their key points. In addition, 
we analyzed the bandwidth efﬁciency of the standard for

CSMA/CA procedure. The efﬁciency results were presented 
for different frequency bands and data rates. We observed that 
increase in the payload size improves the bandwidth efﬁciency. 
We also highlighted different security modes of the standard. 
This paper can be used to quickly understand the key concepts 
of IEEE 802.15.6 without reading the whole standard.
